title: "The Ghost in the White House\r\nSome suggestions as to how a hundred million\
  \ people (who are supposed in a vague, helpless way to haunt the white house) can\
  \ make themselves felt with a president, how they can back him up, express themselves\
  \ to him, be expressed by him, and get what they want"
